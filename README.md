### Challenge 1: Variable naming

<p>
The code in which you will practice these concepts consists of a function that gets a username from Github and returns the same user with a category.
</p>
<p>
The categories will be assigned to the user according to the number of their followers on Github, where if the number of followers is greater than or equal to the minimum number that each category requires, the category that has the most followers will be returned.
</p>
The categories will be as follows:

1. User: I need at least 5 followers to receive this category
2. Friendly: I need at least 50 followers to receive this category
3. Famous: I need at least 500 followers to receive this category
4. Super Star: I need at least 1000 followers to receive this category
<p>
Your goal in this code is not to correct or implement its operation, because it already works, but you should rename variables or even object attributes according to what you have learned, giving meaning to the variables according to the rules above.
</p>

### Challenge 2: Boolean Variable naming

The code in which you will practice these concepts contains logic that represents Diego going to an amusement park, Rocket Park, to ride his favourite toy.

To enter the park there are some rules:

- You need to have a ticket
- The park is open between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.

To ride your favourite toy, Diego just needs to be over 130cm tall.

Your goal in this code is not to fix or implement how it works because it already works, but you should rename variables or even attributes of objects according to what you have learned, giving meaning to the variables according to the rules above.

###  Challenge 3: Cause vs. Effect

The code in which you will practice these concepts contains logic from a React component that makes a call to a function that returns user data.

While the user data is not returned, the `Loading` behaviour is displayed on the screen so that the screen is not blank.

Your goal in this code is not to fix or implement how it works because it already works, but you should rename variables or even object attributes according to what you have learned, giving meaning to the variables according to the rules above.

###  Challenge 4 : Code in English

In this challenge, you'll put into practice everything you've just learned in the `English Code` class from the Clean Code course.

The code in which you will practice these concepts contains logic from a React component that filters a list of products to display on the screen only the products that the user searches for when typing in the input.

Your goal in this code is not to fix or implement how it works because it already works, but you should rename variables or even object attributes according to what you have learned, giving meaning to the variables according to the rules above.

### Challenge: Conditional rules

In this challenge, you'll put into practice everything you've just learned in the `Rules in Conditionals` class in the Clean Code course.

The code in which you will practice these concepts contains a function that checks if a student will pass or fail at the end of the school year.

To pass, there are two rules:

- Your grade must be greater than 7
- Your absences must be less than 100

Your goal in this code is not to fix or implement how it works because it already works, but to reorganize the code in order to apply what you have learned about conditional rules.
