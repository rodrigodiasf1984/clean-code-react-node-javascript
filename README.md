### Challenge 1: Variable naming

#### About the Challenge
<p>
The code in which you will practice these concepts consists of a function that gets a username from Github and returns the same user with a category.
</p>
<p>
The categories will be assigned to the user according to the number of their followers on Github, where if the number of followers is greater than or equal to the minimum number that each category requires, the category that has the most followers will be returned.
</p>
The categories will be as follows:

1. User: I need at least 5 followers to receive this category
2. Friendly: I need at least 50 followers to receive this category
3. Famous: I need at least 500 followers to receive this category
4. Super Star: I need at least 1000 followers to receive this category
<p>
Your goal in this code is not to correct or implement its operation, because it already works, but you should rename variables or even object attributes according to what you have learned, giving meaning to the variables according to the rules above.
